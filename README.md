# Infiniground

Infiniground is a specification for 3d printable modular tabletop wargaming terrain; and a collection of compatible terrain pieces.

The intent is:

* that anyone with basic 3d design skills can design Infiniground-compatible terrain with freely available tools and add it to the community repository
* that individuals or clubs can freely download and print Infiniground terrain 
* that those who wish to design and/or print Infiniground-compatible terrain commercially for sale can do so - however we ask that you contribute your designs to this repository for community use
* that anyone with Infiniground-compatible terrain will be able to connect it to any other Infiniground-compatible terrain
